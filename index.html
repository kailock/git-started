        <p>Phoenix Wright is a young defense attorney who originally became a lawyer to save one of his best friends. He is notorious for "bluffing" in court, but in the end always uncovers the truth because he believes in his client no matter how bad it looks. Phoenix is good at thinking outside the box and pressing dishonest witnesses. His inner dialogue is often sarcastic.</p>
        <p>Phoenix Wright is the title character from the video game franchise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> by Capcom.</p>
